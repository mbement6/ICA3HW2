Welcome to your first run at Git! This is a simple exercise to get you familiar with the basics of Git and GitHub.

## Tutorial of Git and GitHub
- Step 1: make sure you have Git installed on your computer. If you don't, you can download it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Step 2: create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
- Step 3: create a new folder on your computer for this project. Name it whatever you want (ICA3 is a good choice).
- Step 4: Open VS Code to the folder you just made and open a terminal window.
- Step 5: Navigate back to Github.com on the page of this assignmennt, click the fork button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
- Step 6: In the terminal window, type `git clone <url>` where `<url>` is the URL of your forked repository. You can find the URL by clicking the green "Code" button on your repository's main page.
- Step 7: Open the folder in VS Code and make any changes to the files.
- Step 8: In the terminal window, type `git status` to see which files have been changed.
- Step 9: Type `git add <filename>` for each file you want to commit. You can also type `git add .` or `git add --all` to add all files that have been changed.
- Step 10: Type `git commit -m "<message>"` where `<message>` is a short message about the changes you made.
- Step 11: Type `git push` to push your changes to GitHub.
- Step 12: Go to GitHub and refresh the page. You should see your changes there.

## Instructions
- Q1. Insert your name and today's date as a comment in the <head> of the html document
- Q2. Change the html title to the topic of your choice
- Q3. Create a navigation bar that links to two other pages.
- Q4. Stage and commit your changes, with an appropriate commit message about the navbar and title. Push your changes to GitHub.
- Q5. Create the second page that is linked to from the navbar. Add HTML Boilerplate to the second page with the same header as the index.html, but the navigation should be configured for this second page.
- Q6. Create and HTML table with statistics about your topic. The table should include some styling options (e.g. borders, width, height, cellpadding, etc.)

- Q9. Add images to the third page that are relevant to your topic. The images should be easily sectioned with a caption for each image. 
- Q10. Stage and commit your final changes, with a message about the third page and images. Push your final changes to GitHub.
